"In Advanced Mechanics, students built on the concepts they first studied in their 9th grade physics classes by investigating more complex scenarios with more mathematical maturity. They began by reviewing the equations for kinematics and motion, used numerical methods to understand how non-constant forces can affect motion, and used video analysis software to run mechanical experiments. Then they transitioned into a study of rotational motion and torque before concluding with conservation laws. Some students chose to study some units with calculus, while others elected to study through trigonometry and algebra." - Taposhi. Mark, you have really stepped up in this class! You had a very difficult time understanding the concepts initially, but with you hard work and determination you made great improvments. Mark, you recieved 68 and 91 on your most recent projects. Mark, You currnetly have a C+ in this class. You can do better! You have shown nice improvments this semester. There are some easy ways for you to imporve you grade even more. You need to review your fractions, they'll be really helpful next semester, and you should read more of the explanations in the textbook. If you keep improving at the rate you are, then your grade will continue to rise.
