Smith-Schuster,Juju,"""In Advanced Mechanics, students built on the concepts they first studied in their 9th grade physics classes by investigating more complex scenarios with more mathematical maturity. They began by reviewing the equations for kinematics and motion, used numerical methods to understand how non-constant forces can affect motion, and used video analysis software to run mechanical experiments. Then they transitioned into a study of rotational motion and torque before concluding with conservation laws. Some students chose to study some units with calculus, while others elected to study through trigonometry and algebra."" - Taposhi","Juju, you bring a great attitude to class, and you are always paying attention. You stuggle to complete some of the assignments because you were always too focused on how you could apply physics to football and failed to finish your work.",77,75,You should watch Khan academy videos about topics that interest you and do more practice problems so that you're more confident in your understanding.,C,With hardwork and determination I'm certain that you will be able to improve your grade. All you really need to do is finish the tests.

You had a very difficult time understanding the concepts initially, but with you hard work and determination you made great improvments.",68,91,"You need to review your fractions, they'll be really helpful next semester, and you should read more of the explanations in the textbook.",C+,"If you keep improving at the rate you are, then your grade will continue to rise."
Jackson,Mason,"""In Advanced Mechanics, students built on the concepts they first studied in their 9th grade physics classes by investigating more complex scenarios with more mathematical maturity.

Half the time your camera isn't on! You have been very lazy with your homework and it has shown on your tests. You have a decent natural understanding of the concepts, but that understanding has not grown at all throughout the semester.",86,68,You need to do more practice problems to solidify your understanding of different topics and you should spend more time listening during groups discussions. ,C,"If you pull yourself together and start putting in more effort, you should be able to improve your grade considerably."

I actaully have no idea what you look like because you have never turned your camera on once. I constantly have to reach out to you about getting your homework in and you still sometimes get it in late. ",63,62,"You had some trouble with Chapter 3, so go back and review some for next quarter. Also, participate more in class! You always have something insightful to share with us.",D-,"You're last two projects showed a slight dip, but Chapter 3 has been especially difficult for you. Keep putting in the hard work and you'll definitely see an improvement!"

Keep up the good work!",75,89,"You've had some trouble with simple math errors, so make sure to double check you're work and spend more time on each assignment before turning it in.",B-,Nice improvement. Keep up the good work! I can't wait to see your understanding grow as we continue.
