"In Advanced Mechanics, students built on the concepts they first studied in their 9th grade physics classes by investigating more complex scenarios with more mathematical maturity. They began by reviewing the equations for kinematics and motion, used numerical methods to understand how non-constant forces can affect motion, and used video analysis software to run mechanical experiments. Then they transitioned into a study of rotational motion and torque before concluding with conservation laws. Some students chose to study some units with calculus, while others elected to study through trigonometry and algebra." - Taposhi. Mason, you need to put more effort into this class! Half the time your camera isn't on! You have been very lazy with your homework and it has shown on your tests. You have a decent natural understanding of the concepts, but that understanding has not grown at all throughout the semester. Mason, you recieved 86 and 68 on your most recent projects. Mason, You currnetly have a C in this class. You can do better!  There are some easy ways for you to imporve you grade even more. You need to do more practice problems to solidify your understanding of different topics and you should spend more time listening during groups discussions.  If you pull yourself together and start putting in more effort, you should be able to improve your grade considerably.
