"In Advanced Mechanics, students built on the concepts they first studied in their 9th grade physics classes by investigating more complex scenarios with more mathematical maturity. They began by reviewing the equations for kinematics and motion, used numerical methods to understand how non-constant forces can affect motion, and used video analysis software to run mechanical experiments. Then they transitioned into a study of rotational motion and torque before concluding with conservation laws. Some students chose to study some units with calculus, while others elected to study through trigonometry and algebra." - Taposhi. Juju, you bring a great attitude to class, and you are always paying attention. You stuggle to complete some of the assignments because you were always too focused on how you could apply physics to football and failed to finish your work. Juju, you recieved 77 and 75 on your most recent projects. Juju, You currnetly have a C in this class. You can do better!  There are some easy ways for you to imporve you grade even more. You should watch Khan academy videos about topics that interest you and do more practice problems so that you're more confident in your understanding. With hardwork and determination I'm certain that you will be able to improve your grade. All you really need to do is finish the tests.
