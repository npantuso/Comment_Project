"In Advanced Mechanics, students built on the concepts they first studied in their 9th grade physics classes by investigating more complex scenarios with more mathematical maturity. They began by reviewing the equations for kinematics and motion, used numerical methods to understand how non-constant forces can affect motion, and used video analysis software to run mechanical experiments. Then they transitioned into a study of rotational motion and torque before concluding with conservation laws. Some students chose to study some units with calculus, while others elected to study through trigonometry and algebra." - Taposhi. Veronika, you clearly have not payed attention at all this year. I actaully have no idea what you look like because you have never turned your camera on once. I constantly have to reach out to you about getting your homework in and you still sometimes get it in late.  Veronika, you recieved 63 and 62 on your most recent projects. Veronika, You currnetly have a D- in this class. You can do better!  There are some easy ways for you to imporve you grade even more. You had some trouble with Chapter 3, so go back and review some for next quarter. Also, participate more in class! You always have something insightful to share with us. You're last two projects showed a slight dip, but Chapter 3 has been especially difficult for you. Keep putting in the hard work and you'll definitely see an improvement!
