"In Advanced Mechanics, students built on the concepts they first studied in their 9th grade physics classes by investigating more complex scenarios with more mathematical maturity. They began by reviewing the equations for kinematics and motion, used numerical methods to understand how non-constant forces can affect motion, and used video analysis software to run mechanical experiments. Then they transitioned into a study of rotational motion and torque before concluding with conservation laws. Some students chose to study some units with calculus, while others elected to study through trigonometry and algebra." - Taposhi. Mawar, you have been working very hard in this class and it has shown! Keep up the good work! Mawar, you recieved 75 and 89 on your most recent projects. Mawar, You currnetly have a B- in this class. Well Done! There are some easy ways for you to imporve you grade. You've had some trouble with simple math errors, so make sure to double check you're work and spend more time on each assignment before turning it in. Nice improvement. Keep up the good work! I can't wait to see your understanding grow as we continue.
